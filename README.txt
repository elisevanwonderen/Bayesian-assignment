This repository is the research archive with which manuscript.pdf is created, which contains an adapted version of the final assignment I made for the course Bayesian Statistics of the research master Methodology and Statistics for the Social, Behavioural and Biomedical Sciences at Utrecht University. 
To reproduce this manuscript, simply run the file manuscript.rmd in Rstudio.
Manuscript.rmd makes use of the dataset proficiency.rds and the custom-made R functions stored in the Functions folder.
The folder manuscript_cache stores the chunks in the .rmd file for which cache = TRUE, and the folder manuscript_files stores the created plots.
